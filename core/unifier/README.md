`TYCLEX.UNIFIER` responds to prepare unification system.
We use `CL-UNIFICATION` for it.

`TYCLEX` aims to be lisp library, not newly designed languege.
Consequently, we need to coexist with other `CL-UNIFICATION` user.
As a result, we rename it for sandboxing.

This system also responds to provide trivial helpers about unification.
